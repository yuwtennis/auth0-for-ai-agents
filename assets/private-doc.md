**Zeko Advanced Systems Inc. (Ticker: ZEKO)**
**Forecast for Fiscal Year 2025**

**Executive Summary:**

As we look ahead to fiscal year 2025, we maintain a bearish outlook on Zeko Advanced Systems Inc. (ZEKO). Despite the company's stable performance in recent quarters, several factors suggest that ZEKO may underperform the broader market in the coming year. Our analysis considers the company's financial performance, market dynamics, and strategic positioning, which collectively indicate potential headwinds that could hinder growth and profitability.

**Revenue Growth Challenges:**

While Zeko reported a modest 2.3% increase in revenue for Q3 2024, this growth rate lags behind industry peers and suggests potential challenges in sustaining momentum. The company's reliance on digital health solutions and AI-driven patient monitoring devices, while innovative, may face increased competition from both established players and new entrants. Additionally, economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions could dampen demand in key emerging markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, where Zeko is focusing its expansion efforts.

**Margin Pressures:**

Zeko's gross margin declined slightly to 55% in Q3 2024, primarily due to rising raw material costs and ongoing supply chain disruptions. These pressures are expected to persist into 2025, further compressing margins and impacting profitability. Additionally, the company's significant investment in research and development, while necessary for innovation, may not yield immediate returns, thereby straining operating margins.

**Operational and Strategic Concerns:**

Despite Zeko's commitment to innovation and strategic partnerships, the pace of product development and market adoption may not be sufficient to drive significant revenue growth. The introduction of new AI-driven platforms and minimally invasive surgical technologies, while promising, may face regulatory hurdles and require extensive validation before achieving widespread adoption. Furthermore, the company's expansion into emerging markets presents inherent risks, including currency fluctuations and regulatory challenges.

**Financial Outlook:**

- **Revenue:** We project Zeko's revenue growth to remain subdued, with an estimated increase of 2-3% for fiscal year 2025. This projection reflects the anticipated competitive pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties that could limit market expansion.

- **Net Income:** Net income growth is expected to be modest, with potential headwinds from increased operational costs and margin pressures. We forecast a net income increase of 1-2% year-over-year.

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Given the expected challenges in revenue and net income growth, we anticipate EPS to grow at a similar rate of 1-2%, potentially reaching $1.64 to $1.65 for fiscal year 2025.

- **Gross Margin:** Gross margin is likely to remain under pressure, potentially declining further to 54-55% as cost challenges persist.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, while Zeko Advanced Systems Inc. continues to demonstrate resilience and a commitment to innovation, the company faces significant challenges that may impede its ability to outperform the market in fiscal year 2025. Investors should remain cautious and consider these potential headwinds when evaluating ZEKO as an investment opportunity. The company's strategic focus on emerging markets and new product development, while commendable, may not deliver the desired financial performance in the near term. As such, we maintain a bearish outlook on Zeko's prospects for the upcoming fiscal year.
